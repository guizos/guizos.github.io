Welcome to my brand new personal website! I am a proud *madrileño* from Spain working as a Lecturer within the Information Security group at Royal Holloway, University of London. This is a kind of a new year's resolution. My intention is to keep this website as updated as possible, adding all my recent publications and posting new stuff in the blog from time to time. I will generally post about academic stuff (research, papers, teaching, etc.) but I also intend to post about other random stuff that I find interesting. I hope you like it! If you have any comments or questions, do not hesitate to write me an email (you can find it on the [homepage]({{site.url}})).
