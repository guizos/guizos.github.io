Our new MOOC Information Security: Context and Introduction is now available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-security-data). The course provides a very brief introduction to the rapid changing-field of information security. We have structured in 5 weeks. During the first week [Prof. Peter Komisarczuk](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/peter-komisarczuk(2f94b004-09d5-44ca-ba25-f2866f5c9bc7).html) presents the main concepts and definitions related to information security. [Prof. Keith M. Martin](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~martin/) introduces one of the main building blocks of information security: Cryptography. During the third and fourth week I present the main concepts behind computer and network security, and security management. Finally, on the last week of the course, Peter shows a model of the information security industry and presents the roles, careers and professional bodies in the information security industry.

We created this course so people with a limited technical background can follow and understand the main concepts behind information security. One of the benefits of Coursera as a MOOC platform is that it starts a new course session every week. This allows students to start the course when they want without having to wait until a specified start date.
Enjoy!
