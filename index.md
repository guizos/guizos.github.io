I am a Lecturer in Information Security within the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway University of London.  Before this I was a Research Fellow in the School of Engineering and Mathematics at City University London working in the ACID project, an EPSRC funded project about Android App Collusion. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2012 at Carlos III University of Madrid (COSEC Lab). 

All my research interests are related to Information Security, including: Android and wearable security, biometrics, information leakage and steganography among others. In this website, you will be able to find my list of publications, projects I've worked on and other links and stuff I find interesting. I also intend to write some blog posts from time to time. This is a kind of new year resolution, we'll see if I keep it.
