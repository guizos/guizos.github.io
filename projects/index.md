During the past years, I've worked on the following projects:

## SEEK

SEEK Stands for Steganalytic vidEo rEsearch frameworK. The goal of SEEK is to develop fast and accurate algorithms to detect the usage of video steganography online and offline. I worked on SEEK from April 2016 until September 2016, when I joined Royal Holloway as a Lecturer.

## [ACiD](http://acidproject.org.uk) ![ACiD Logo]({{ site.url }}/images/acid-logo.png)
 ACiD is a collaborative project funded by the EPSRC between City University London, Swansea University, Coventry University and Intel Security (McAfee). ACiD started in July 2014 and it is planned to be completed by July 2017. From July 2014 until April 2016, I worked in ACiD as a Research Fellow. You can look at some of our publications in the [Publications]({{ site.url }}/publications/) section. Part or our work on ACiD was featured on McAfee Labs June 2016 Threat Report [pdf](http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-may-2016.pdf).
